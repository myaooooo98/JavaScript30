    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[4] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players, team);
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[4] = 'Dream';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[5] = "Hee";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    console.log(captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Object.assign(blank object, object intended to be copied, new properties to be included)
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 90, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: "Wes",
      age: 20,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = "Wesley";
    console.log(dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social);
    console.log(dev.social);
    // change both because Object.assign() only go 1 level deep

    // JSON.stringify() turn the whole object into string
    // JSON.parse() turn it into an object again
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = '@wesbos';
